# This repo is for you to use for your homework assignments
I setup a template for you of what this might look like but you can re-arrange and edit this however you want.

The only things you should not change are:
1. The `Forecast_Submissions` folder
2. The `Cheat_Sheets` folders

These are where you will put assignments you want me to grade. They should always be labeled clearly with the homework assignment number in the folder.
